# Telly-Server

just having a bit of fun with react/redux. 

- the purpose of this application is to make and manage lists of whatever shows we are watching at the moment
- telly-server is responsible for providing a REST API, for consumption by the companion app, telly-client
- core data sits squarely in our own domain, with storage in Mongo, but we may add some TVDB integrations to add extra meta or provide search by name
